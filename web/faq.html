    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <p><b>What's OPML?</b></p>
    <p>OPML, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML">Outline Processor Markup Language</a> is an XML-like language
        commonly used to encode a bunch of RSS subscriptions. In most feed readers, like
        Feedbin or NetNewsWire, have an option to export their subscriptions in the format, so they could be imported into
        other feed readers.
    </p>
    <p><b>What a Blogroll?</b></p>
    <p>A <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blogroll">blogrroll</a> is a collection of to other blogs or sites that a blogger recommends.
    </p>
    <p><b>Where does my OPML file go?</b></p>
    <p>It'll go to a Netlify function to be parsed and converted into a HTML file. I suppose, if I was a better JavaScript
        programmer, it would've been possible to do it in the browser. But it's easier for me to use Go for this.
    </p>
    <p><b>Is my OPML file stored anywhere?</b></p>
    <p>Absolutely not. The OPML file is used only to generate the HTML snippet, and then forgot about. It may be stored
        on disk temporarily, but that's just to assist with handling the request (small OPML files should only ever be stored
        in memory).
    </p> 
    <p><b>How big can my OPML file be?</b></p>
    <p>
        Your OPML file can be up to 10 MB. In order to prevent possible issues with large files, only the first
        1000 feed items will be included in the output, and we'll only go into groups up to 10 levels deep (you can have
        as many groups as you like though).
    </p>
    <p><b>I seam to recall this being a bit of a thing back in the 2000's. Are people still doing this?</b></p>
    <p>Absolutely. In fact, people never stopped doing this. It has seen a bit of a resurgence in recent years though,
        thanks to the imposion of certain social networks and people rediscovering the magic of blogging and RSS.
    </p>
    <p><b>Help, I tried uploading an OPML file and it didn't work for me.</b></p>
    <p>I'm sorry to hear that. The best thing I can suggest is maybe trying again, and just making sure that what you're trying
        to upload is a proper OPML file (it'll look like an XML file). If that's still not working for you, feel free to
        <a href="https://github.com/lmika/opml-to-blogroll/issues">raise an issue</a> and I can look at it when I get the chance
        (this is just some fun so I can't promise a speedy turnaround time).
